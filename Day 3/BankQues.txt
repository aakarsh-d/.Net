======================================================================

TASK 1: Core OOP Design (Conceptual Understanding)

Objective
Understand and map real-world healthcare entities to OOP concepts.

Tasks for Students

Identify and justify the use of:

Classes

Objects

Fields

Methods

Explain how encapsulation is applied to protect patient medical data.

Explain why OOP is suitable for healthcare systems compared to procedural programming.

======================================================================

TASK 2: Patient Class – Data Security Task

Functionality
Represents a patient and ensures secure handling of personal and medical data.

Mandatory Requirements

A Patient class must exist.

PatientId

Must be initialized only through a constructor

Must be read-only

Must not change after object creation

Name

Must be a public property

Must have both getter and setter

Age

Must be a public property

Must have both getter and setter

medicalHistory

Must be declared as a private field

Must not be accessible directly from outside the class

A default constructor must not be created.

Methods

SetMedicalHistory(string history)

Must store medical history internally

Must not expose the private field

GetMedicalHistory()

Must return the stored medical history

Must not allow modification through this method

Expected Outcome

Patient identity remains immutable

Medical data remains protected using encapsulation

======================================================================

TASK 3: Doctor Class – Static and Readonly Behavior Task

Functionality
Represents a doctor and tracks the total number of doctors in the hospital.

Mandatory Requirements

Static Member

TotalDoctors

Must be declared as a static integer variable

Must track the total number of doctor objects created

Readonly Member

LicenseNumber

Must be declared as a readonly string

Must be assigned during object creation

Must not be modified afterward

Instance Properties

Name

Public property

Getter and setter

Specialization

Public property

Getter and setter

Static Constructor

Must initialize TotalDoctors

Must execute before any doctor object is created

Instance Constructor

Must accept:

Doctor name

Specialization

License number

Must assign values to:

Name

Specialization

LicenseNumber

Must increment TotalDoctors by exactly 1

Validation Rules

License number must remain immutable

Name and Specialization must be modifiable

Static member must reflect correct doctor count

======================================================================

EXTRA TASK: Inheritance – Cardiologist Class

Requirements

Create a Cardiologist class that inherits from Doctor

Child class constructor must explicitly call parent constructor

Usage

Display static member TotalDoctors using child class

Display non-static doctor details using child object

Expected Outcome

Clear demonstration of inheritance

Correct access to static and instance members

======================================================================

TASK 4: Appointment Class – Method Overloading Task

Functionality
Schedules consultations between patients and doctors using method overloading.

Mandatory Requirements

Appointment class must exist

Method 1: Basic Scheduling

Public static method: Schedule

Parameters:

Patient p

Doctor d

Displays:

Patient name

Doctor name

Method 2: Scheduling with Date and Mode

Overloaded Schedule method

Parameters:

Patient p

Doctor d

DateTime date

string mode (default = "Offline")

Displays:

Appointment date

Consultation mode

Strict Constraints

Only two Schedule methods allowed

No instance-level methods

Must be callable without object creation

Expected Outcome

Correct method overloading

Proper default parameter usage

======================================================================

TASK 5: Diagnosis Service – Advanced Parameter Task

Class

DiagnosisService

Stateless (no fields)

Method

public static void Evaluate

Parameters (exact order)

in int age

ref string condition

out string riskLevel

params int[] testScores

Internal Logic

Sum all testScores

Local static function IsCritical(int totalScore)

Returns true if score > 250

Decision Rules

If critical OR age > 60:

condition = "Serious"

riskLevel = "High"

Else:

riskLevel = "Moderate"

Constraints

age must not be modified

riskLevel must always be assigned

No additional Evaluate methods

======================================================================

TASK 6: Billing Class – Object Initializer Task

Class

Bill

Properties

double ConsultationFee

double TestCharges

double RoomCharges

Method

public double Total()

Returns sum of all charges

Object Creation

Must use object initializer syntax only

Constraints

No parameterized constructors

No hardcoded totals

======================================================================

TASK 7: Insurance Service – Coverage Calculation

Class

InsuranceService (stateless)

Method

public static double ApplyCoverage(double billAmount, int coveragePercent)

Calculation

discount = (billAmount * coveragePercent) / 100

return billAmount - discount

Constraints

No stored data

Pure function

======================================================================

TASK 8: Recursion – Hospital Stay Calculation

Method

static int CalculateStayDays(int days)

Logic

If days <= 0 → return 0

Else → return 1 + CalculateStayDays(days - 1)

Constraints

No loops

Only recursion

======================================================================

TASK 9: Input Validation – Age Parsing

Class

InputHelper

Method

public static int ReadAge(string input)

Rules

Use TryParse

If valid → return age

If invalid → throw exception with message "Invalid age input"

Constraints

No default values

No I/O operations

======================================================================

TASK 10: System Initialization – Static Constructor

Class

HospitalSystem

Constant

const string HospitalName

Static Constructor

Displays system boot message

Executes before Main()

Runs only once

======================================================================

TASK 11: Main Program Flow – End-to-End Execution

Steps

Create Patient

Set medical history via method

Create Doctor

Schedule appointment (Online, current date)

Perform diagnosis evaluation

Display condition and risk level

Create Bill using object initializer

Calculate total bill

Apply insurance coverage

Display final payable amount

Error Handling

On any error, display exactly:
Invalid Input

Constraints

No business logic in Main

All operations via method calls

======================================================================
