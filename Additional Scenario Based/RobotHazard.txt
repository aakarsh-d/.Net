Develop a Factory Robot Hazard Analyzer system that evaluates the hazard risk score of a factory robot based on arm precision, worker density, and machinery state. The system must validate all inputs, calculate the hazard risk score, and handle invalid scenarios using a custom exception.

Functionalities:

In the class RobotHazardAuditor, implement the specified method:

Method:
public double CalculateHazardRisk(double armPrecision, int workerDensity, string machineryState)

This method calculates and returns the hazard risk score.

Rules and Validations:

1. The armPrecision must be in the range of 0.0 to 1.0.
   If it is not in the range, throw a user-defined exception called RobotSafetyException with the message:
   "Error: Arm precision must be 0.0-1.0"

2. The workerDensity must be in the range of 1 to 20.
   If it is not in the range, throw a user-defined exception called RobotSafetyException with the message:
   "Error: Worker density must be 1-20"

3. The machineryState must be one of the following values only:
   "Worn", "Faulty", or "Critical"

   If it is not one of these values, throw a user-defined exception called RobotSafetyException with the message:
   "Error: Unsupported machinery state"

   The machineryState is case-sensitive.

If armPrecision, workerDensity and machineryState are valid, then calculate the hazard risk using the formula given below.

Machine Risk Factor for machinery state:

Worn     -> 1.3  
Faulty   -> 2.0  
Critical -> 3.0  

Hazard Risk Calculation Formula:

Hazard Risk = ((1.0 - armPrecision) * 15.0) + (workerDensity * machineRiskFactor)

Note:

The Exception object itself should display the message.
To do this, create a class RobotSafetyException that inherits from the Exception class.

In the Program class, write the Main method and call the CalculateHazardRisk method and print:

"Robot Hazard Risk Score: <risk>"

If there is any exception thrown, use a catch block to handle the exception returned by the CalculateHazardRisk method.
In the catch block, display the exception message.

Refer to the sample input and output.

Cautions:

- Keep the method public.
- Please read the method rules clearly.
- Do not use Environment.Exit() to terminate the program.
- Do not change the given code template.
