1-Hour Assignment
Insurance Management System (OOP Based)

Below is a clean, professional, exam / lab–ready PROBLEM STATEMENT for the given C# program, followed by the Expected Output.
This is written exactly in the style teachers expect for practical exams, assignments, or viva questions.

Problem Statement
Title: Insurance Management System using Advanced OOP Concepts in C#

Objective
Design and implement a console-based Insurance Management System in C# that demonstrates the use of advanced object-oriented programming concepts including:
Sealed classes
Abstract base classes
Inheritance and method overriding
Method hiding using new keyword
Init-only properties
Encapsulation with validation
Indexers
Runtime polymorphism

Problem Description
You are required to build an Insurance System for an insurance company that manages different types of insurance policies. The system must follow real-world business rules and strict object-oriented design principles.

System Requirements
1. Security Module
Create a sealed class that handles user authentication.
This class must not be inherited.
It should display a confirmation message after authentication.

2. Base Insurance Policy
Create an abstract base class named InsurancePolicy.
The class should contain:
An init-only property for Policy Number
A validated premium property (premium must be greater than zero)
A policy holder name
Include:
A virtual method to calculate the premium
A method to display generic policy information


3. Derived Insurance Types
a) Life Insurance
Inherit from InsurancePolicy
Override the premium calculation method by adding a fixed life-insurance charge
Demonstrate method hiding by redefining the policy display method
b) Health Insurance
Inherit from InsurancePolicy
Override the premium calculation method
Seal the overridden method to prevent further modification

4. Policy Directory (Indexer Implementation)
Create a class that stores multiple insurance policies.
Use a List internally to store policies.
Implement indexers to:
Access policies by index
Access policies by policy holder name

5. Main Program Execution
The main program should:
Authenticate the user
Create life and health insurance policies
Store them in the policy directory
Retrieve policy details using indexers
Demonstrate:
Runtime polymorphism using overridden methods
Method hiding using base and derived class references

Expected Output
User authenticated successfully

Amit
102
Life Premium: 5500
Health Premium: 8000
Life Insurance Policy
Insurance Policy


Explanation of Output
Authentication message
Displayed by the sealed security class.
Indexer by index
Displays the holder name of the first policy (Amit).
Indexer by name
Displays the policy number of the policy holder named Neha.
Runtime polymorphism
Correct premium calculation based on actual object type.
Method hiding demonstration
Calling ShowPolicy() using a derived reference prints:
Life Insurance Policy


Calling the same method using a base-class reference prints:
Insurance Policy
